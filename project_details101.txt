The dataset we are using for the crime detection system is the one provided by the boston city.

The boston city made there crime datasets open sourced, so we used there datasets to create an app based on 

flutter and dart. The application is built with them and a model is fit to make a prediction.

The application uses the the geo-location of the customer which we use along with the date and time 

to make a prediction as to if there are any chances of any crime in that region and if yes then what 

kind of crime is expected to occur in that region.

These details comes as a notification to the user as to if there are any chances of crime in the region and what

sort. We are also using providing as        
  
                                  SOS
                                  
support for the user. The user can tap on the button if he is in some kind of danger.

It sends a notification to the ploce control room about the emergency of an indian citizen along with the geo 

coordinates.

We can use the mobile phone of the user to track them down in this scenario.

The second message is sent to the user's relatives which he has provided to contact in the case of any emergency.

Hopefully this way we can put some control to the number of crimes occuring in the city.

There is also an option to automate the process of starting the camera in order to make a recording of the scenes

and upload that data onto a cloud server. These can also help us to locate down the criminals as the videos 

and images act as a valid proof to take actions.

This is the actual project proposed by us to reduce and alert the users about the crime in a region for our

CRIME PREDICTION AND DETECTION APPLICATION
